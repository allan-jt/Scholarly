# Scholarly

Scholarly is a web application designed to assist researchers in conducting literature reviews by providing detailed summaries of papers relevant to their search queries. Currently demonstrated with arXiv as a proof of concept, Scholarly retrieves and summarizes papers from research databases to help researchers quickly evaluate content and streamline the discovery process. Paper retrieval is performed through API calls, while summaries are generated by dividing papers into chunks and processing them using large language models (LLMs). These processes can be computationally demanding due to the overhead of API calls, the need to process numerous chunks across multiple papers, and the inference time of LLMs. To overcome these challenges, Scholarly leverages Spark to parallelize its workflows, as processing and summarizing individual papers can be handled independently.
